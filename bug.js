This error occurs when using the `useRef` hook in React Native and trying to access its current value before it's been assigned.  It often manifests when attempting to access the ref's value within the same render cycle where the ref is initialized or when the component renders for the first time.

```javascript
// Bug: Accessing useRef before it's populated
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    // This might fail if myRef.current is accessed too soon
    console.log(myRef.current); // Might be null
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Hello</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```
