The solution involves checking for `null` before accessing the ref:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React, { useRef, useEffect } from 'react';
import { View, Text } from 'react-native';

const MyComponent = () => {
  const myRef = useRef(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    if (myRef.current) {
      console.log(myRef.current);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <View>
      <Text ref={myRef}>Hello</Text>
    </View>
  );
};

export default MyComponent;
```

Alternatively, you can use a conditional rendering to only execute code that relies on the ref's current value after the ref has been populated.  Another option is to move the logic that depends on `myRef.current` inside a callback function set as an event handler.
